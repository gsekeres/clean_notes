# Clean Notes

Contained in here are clean versions of my notes from the first year Economics sequence at Cornell University. They are divided by term and then by course.

# Updates

- 12/01/24: Created repo, added structure for micro notes (will be collaborative). Micro notes contain through Easley's section.

# For contributors

Please let me know what section you would like to contribute to! I will deal with the general formatting and LaTeX-ing, converting everything to my style. Ideally, we'd have only one person work on a section at a time. PLEASE remember to pull the repo before editing, and then push them to your branch so we can merge them. If you need help with git, let me know. I've written everything to work in Texifier, and will make edits so that it still works there. Everything should work in local LaTeX, especially in VSCode or Cursor, but there may be some issues. I will fix errors when they come up.

# Current structure:

- Easley (choice): Gabe
- Kircher (consumer): __
- Harris (producer): __
- Blume (uncertainty): __
- Barseghyan (uncertainty 2): __
- Battaglini (information / game theory): __
- Exercises: Gabe will add, along with solutions

# Other sources I'm using: 

- Easley notes
- Slides from Harris, Blume, and Barseghyan
- Allegedly, notes from Battaglini. He hasn't sent them yet.
- Tak's math notes
- Textbooks: MWG, Johnsonbaugh and Pfaffenberger's Foundations of Mathematical Analysis
- Stanford's first year micro notes. I can send these to whomever wants them
